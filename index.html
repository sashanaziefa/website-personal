<h1>My Experience during MCO</h1>
<p>During MCO, i hade done various activities such as i learnt how to cook with my mother, i took extra cares of my cats and also during this MCO i can do my favorite activity which is baking. And i also made various types of "kuih" since we cannot get them outside. This MCO period does not give any bad impacts to me because i can spend more time with my family and i can also learn a lot of things in order to prepare myself in future</p>
